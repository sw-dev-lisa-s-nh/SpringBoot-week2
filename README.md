BESD Coding Bootcamp Spring Boot Week 2 Coding Assignment


BESD Coding Bootcamp Spring Boot Week 2

Our assignment this week was to work through an Inventory Management API Tutorial, where we created a Maven Project, added parent and dependencies to the pom.xml file, added an application.properties file, and then created our App, MembershipLevel, OrderStatus, controllers:  Customer, Product & Order, entities:  Customer, Product, Address & Orders, repositories: Customer, Products, Address & Orders, AND services: Customer, Product & Orders.

As my second attempt to get a Maven Project working, this provided a great exercise to work through this tutorial, which built the application level by level explaining each step along the way.  I think the hardest part is getting all of the moving pieces working together, logging the dependencies, and testing!

My favorite part of this coding assignment was finding, debugging, and working through a solution with one of our Promineo Tech mentors (Thanks Jeffrey!) to fix the product_order table in the inventory_api database.
